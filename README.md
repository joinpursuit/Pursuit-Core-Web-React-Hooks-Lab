# Pursuit-Core-Web-React-Hooks-Lab

## Tasks

Refactor **at least two** of the following labs/projects to use hooks. Do not use any class components, only functions with `useState` and/or `useEffect`. As you refactor, run the jest and cypress tests, and make sure that your tests still pass.

2. [React Forms Lab: Array Statistics](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web-React-Forms-Lab-Tested)
